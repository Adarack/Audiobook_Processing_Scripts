The UnRaid Config

You will need to use docker to install auto-m4b and beets. beets has a few extra items that need to be configured.

At the time of this writing the audible plugin for beets from linuxserver.io only supports up to v2.3.0. 
So when installing the Community Applications template make sure to set the Repository to lscr.io/linuxserver/beets:2.3.0

After configuring it how you like and starting it for the first time, stop the container.

In user/appdata/beets
Rename the default config.yaml to config.yaml.stock
Paste beets-audible.config.yaml and the custom-cont-init.d directory
Rename beets-audible.config.yaml to config.yaml and edit the directories in the config.yaml to match your setup.



Next, for the linuxserver docker mods. https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods
Edit the beets container in the UnRaid docker UI. 
Click "Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device"

Config Type: Path
Name: custom-cont-init.d
Container Path: /custom-cont-init.d
Host Path: /mnt/user/appdata/beets/custom-cont-init.d/

Finally start the container again. It will run the install-deps.sh script on startup and install the beets-audible beets-copyartifacts3 beets[web] plugins for beets.
